# DatReader

This is a JS application, that reads GW2.dat. We package it so that our Godot program can run it with QuickJS.

> Why like this? This is the architecture I need for another project, so this is perfect practice for that :D
> We could also re-implement GW2.dat reading in GDScript - in fact, I started that! - but it's a maintenance head ache,
> I'd rather skip now. Also, we could implement the GUI part with a JS framework, e.g. Phaser, but
> I really want Godot experience now.
