```xml
<Decorations version="1" mapId="1853" mapName="((X06 Homestead Plot))" type="0">
    <prop 
        id="1038"
        name="((Island Tree (Curved)))"
        pos="8156.226562 10458.050781 205.136719"
        rot="0.147262 6.258642 3.657010"
        scl="0.519841"
    />
</Decorations>
```

I think this tells us all that we need to get started!
